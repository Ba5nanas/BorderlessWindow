BorderlessWindow
================

This is a basic win32 example of a borderless window (with aero shadows).

Includes project an solution files (created with VS 2013 RC).

In case you can't open them, it's just a default empty Win32 project,
with Linker->Advanced->EntryPoint set to mainCRTStartup.
(That way I can use a regular int main() instead of WinMain(...))
